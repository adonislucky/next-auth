# Next.js

## `unstable_getServerSession`

:::warning
This feature is experimental and may be removed or changed in the future.
:::

When calling from server-side i.e. in API routes or in `getServerSideProps`, we recommend using this function instead of `getSession` to retrieve the `session` object. This method is especially useful when you are using NextAuth.js with a database. This method can _drastically_ reduce response time when used over `getSession` server-side, due to avoiding an extra `fetch` to an API Route (this is generally [not recommended in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props#getserversideprops-or-api-routes)). In addition, `unstable_getServerSession` will correctly update the cookie expiry time and update the session content if `callbacks.jwt` or `callbacks.session` changed something.

Otherwise, if you only want to get the session token, see [`getToken`](tutorials/securing-pages-and-api-routes#using-gettoken).

`unstable_getServerSession` requires passing the same object you would pass to `NextAuth` when initializing NextAuth.js. To do so, you can export your NextAuth.js options in the following way:

In `[...nextauth.js]`:
```ts
import { NextAuth } from 'next-auth'
import type { NextAuthOptions } from 'next-auth'
 
export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
  // your configs
}

export default NextAuth(authOptions);
```

In `getServerSideProps`:
```js
import { authOptions } from 'pages/api/[...nextauth]'
import { unstable_getServerSession } from "next-auth/next"

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const session = await unstable_getServerSession(context.req, context.res, authOptions)

  if (!session) {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: '/',
        permanent: false,
      },
    }
  }

  return {
    props: {
      session,
    },
  }
}
```
In API routes:
```js
import { authOptions } from 'pages/api/[...nextauth]'
import { unstable_getServerSession } from "next-auth/next"


export async function handler(req, res) {
  const session = await unstable_getServerSession(req, res, authOptions)

  if (!session) {
    res.status(401).json({ message: "You must be logged in." });
    return;
  }

  return res.json({
    message: 'Success',
  })
}
```

## Middleware

You can use a Next.js Middleware with NextAuth.js to protect your site.

Next.js 12 has introduced [Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/middleware). It is a way to run logic before accessing any page, even when they are static. On platforms like Vercel, Middleware is run at the [Edge](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/edge-runtime).

If the following options look familiar, this is because they are a subset of [these options](/configuration/options#options). You can extract these to a common configuration object to reuse them. In the future, we would like to be able to run everything in Middleware. (See [Caveats](#caveats)).

You can get the `withAuth` middleware function from `next-auth/middleware` either as a default or a named import:

### Prerequisites

You must set the [`NEXTAUTH_SECRET`](/configuration/options#nextauth_secret) environment variable when using this middleware. If you are using the [`secret` option](/configuration/options#secret) this value must match.

**We strongly recommend** replacing the `secret` value completely with this `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` environment variable. This environment variable will be picked up by both the [NextAuth config](/configuration/options#options), as well as the middleware config.


### Basic usage
```js
import withAuth from "next-auth/middleware"
// or
import { withAuth } from "next-auth/middleware"
```

### Custom JWT decode method

If you have custom jwt decode method set in `[...nextauth].ts`, you must also pass the same `decode` method to `withAuth` in order to read the custom-signed JWT correctly. You may want to extract the encode/decode logic to a separate function for consistency.

`[...nextauth].ts`
```ts
import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";

export default NextAuth({
  providers: [...],
  secret: /* Please use `process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET` */,
  jwt: {
    encode: async ({ secret, token }) => {
      return jwt.sign(token as any, secret);
    },
    decode: async ({ secret, token }) => {
      return jwt.verify(token as string, secret) as any;
    },
  },
})
```

Any `_middleware.ts`
```ts
import withAuth from "next-auth/middleware"
import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";

export default withAuth({
  jwt: {
    decode: async ({ secret, token }) => {
      return jwt.verify(token, secret) as any;
    },
  },
  callbacks: {
    authorized: ({ token }) => !!token,
  },
})
```
---
### `callbacks`

- **Required:** No

#### Description

Callbacks are asynchronous functions you can use to control what happens when an action is performed.

#### Example (default value)

```js
 callbacks: {
   authorized({ req , token }) {
     if(token) return true // If there is a token, the user is authenticated
   }
 }
```

---

### `pages`

- **Required**: _No_

#### Description

Specify URLs to be used if you want to create custom sign in, and error pages. Pages specified will override the corresponding built-in page.

#### Example (default value)

```js
pages: {
  signIn: '/auth/signin',
  error: '/auth/error',
}
```

See the documentation for the [pages option](/configuration/pages) for more information.

---

### Examples

`withAuth` is very flexible, there are multiple ways to use it.

:::note
If you do not define the options, NextAuth.js will use the default values for the omitted options.
:::

#### default re-export

```js title="pages/_middleware.js"
export { default } from "next-auth/middleware"
```

With this one line, when someone tries to load any of your pages, they will have to be logged-in first. Otherwise, they are redirected to the login page. It will assume that you are using the `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` environment variable.

#### default `withAuth` export

```js title="pages/admin/_middleware.js"
import { withAuth } from "next-auth/middleware"

export default withAuth({
  callbacks: {
    authorized: ({ token }) => token?.role === "admin",
  },
})
```

With the above code, you just made sure that only user's with the `admin` role can access any of the pages under the `/admin` route. (Including nested routes as well, like `/admin/settings` etc.).

#### wrap middleware

```ts title="pages/admin/_middleware.ts"
import type { NextRequest } from "next/server"
import type { JWT } from "next-auth/jwt"

import { withAuth } from "next-auth/middleware"

export default withAuth(
  function middleware(req: NextRequest & { nextauth: { token: JWT } }) {
    console.log(req.nextauth.token)
  },
  {
    callbacks: {
      authorized: ({ token }) => token?.role === "admin",
    },
  }
)
```

The `middleware` function will only be invoked if the `authorized` callback returns `true`.

---

### Caveats

- Currently only supports session verification, as parts of the sign-in code need to run in a Node.js environment. In the future, we would like to make sure that NextAuth.js can fully run at the [Edge](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/edge-runtime)
- Only supports the `"jwt"` [session strategy](/configuration/options#session). We need to wait until databases at the Edge become mature enough to ensure a fast experience. (If you know of an Edge-compatible database, we would like if you proposed a new [Adapter](/tutorials/creating-a-database-adapter))
